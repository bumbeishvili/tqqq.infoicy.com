## üìà Strategy Overview

This strategy implements a refined approach to leveraged ETF trading that has been backtested since 2003 and developed with input from the LETF (Leveraged ETF) trading community.

### Core Strategy Components

1. **SPY 200SMA Signal System**
   - **BUY TQQQ**: When SPY price is **+4%** above its 200-day Simple Moving Average
   - **SELL TQQQ**: When SPY price drops to **-3%** below its 200-day Simple Moving Average

2. **QQQ DCA Strategy During Downturns**
   - When SELL signal triggers, move to cash/SGOV initially
   - Slowly Dollar-Cost Average (DCA) into QQQ over 6-12 months
   - Continue DCA until SPY returns to +4% above 200SMA
   - When BUY signal returns, sell all QQQ positions and return to 100% TQQQ

3. **Bubble Protection Mechanism**
   - **30% Deleverage Signal**: When QQQ is 30% above its 200SMA, deleverage from TQQQ to QQQ
   - **40% Exit Signal**: When QQQ is 40% above its 200SMA, exit to cash (extreme bubble protection)

## üéØ Strategy Advantages

### Why SPY Instead of QQQ for Primary Signals?
- SPY provides broader market representation
- Reduces sector-specific noise in signals
- More stable and reliable trend identification
- Backtesting shows superior performance since 2003

### Why QQQ DCA Instead of Bonds/Cash?
- Historical data shows QQQ DCA averaging **+6.91%** returns during down periods
- Only two negative periods: **-8%** (2022 rate hikes) and **-24%** (2008 crash)
- Significantly outperforms bond/cash strategies over time
- Maintains growth potential during market recovery phases

### Bubble Protection Benefits
- Guards against "dot-com level" crash scenarios
- Provides automated risk management for extreme market conditions
- Rare but critical protection mechanism
- Preserves capital during unprecedented market bubbles
